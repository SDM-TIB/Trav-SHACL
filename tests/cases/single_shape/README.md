# Test Cases with a Single Shape

The test cases with a single shape consider the instances of the class `ClassA` except for case 9 which is testing a shape that has no matching instances in the data.

The following cases are tested:
1. One constraint with a minimal cardinality of `1`
2. One constraint with a minimal cardinality of `3`
3. One constraint with a maximal cardinality of `0`
4. One constraint with a maximal cardinality of `2`
5. Combination of a min and a max constraint
6. Combination of two min constraints
7. Combination of two max constraints
8. Shape without constraints
9. Shape without any matching instances in the data
